/**
 * Allows the usage of {@link DescribableModel} to be fine-tuned to cover special cases such as backwards compatibility.
 * Implement this interface on a {@link Descriptor}.
 * <p>Normally introspection of a struct class with {@link DataBoundConstructor} and {@link DataBoundSetter} suffices for databinding.
 * This facility allows the definer of the struct to accept variant inputs to {@link DescribableModel#instantiate(Map)},
 * or recommend variant outputs for {@link DescribableModel#uninstantiate2(Object)}.
 * This is somewhat analogous to implementing a {@code readResolve} method to customize XStream serialization behavior.
 * <p>These are relatively high-level (syntactic) transformations,
 * including details such as {@link UninstantiatedDescribable#ANONYMOUS_KEY} vs. {@link DescribableModel#CLAZZ}.
 * On the one hand, that allows implementations precise control over behavior.
 * On the other hand, it means that implementations must sometimes take care
 * to handle several surface variants of the same underlying data model.
 * <p>Only those methods explicitly indicated are customized by this interface,
 * so for example {@link DescribableModel#getSoleRequiredParameter} will continue to be determined
 * entirely by Java reflection.
 * Furthermore, only those use cases (such as Pipeline and some modes of Job DSL)
 * which run inside the Jenkins master and use the indicated methods will honor customizations made in this way;
 * in particular, the Configuration as Code plugin currently will not,
 * and anything that relies on inspection of bytecode from an external process cannot.
 * Therefore it is best to limit usage of this API to preserving compatibility
 * or otherwise adjusting behavior in ways that cannot be done otherwise.
 * <p>Arguments passed to customization methods are immutable.
 * If you wish to make changes, create and return a copy of the argument.
